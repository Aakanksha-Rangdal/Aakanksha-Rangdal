# 🌸 Hi, I'm Aakanksha

Frontend Engineer. UX Thinker. Builder of pretty + powerful things.

Currently working as an **Information Technology Specialist 2** at the New York State Office of Information Technology Services, re-platforming NYBE 2.0 with a Java backend and a React + TypeScript frontend.

I care about:
- Clean UI
- Thoughtful UX
- Scalable architecture
- Code that doesn’t make future-me cry

## 💻 What I Do

✨ Frontend Development (React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind)  
✨ UX & Interface Design (Figma)  
✨ Component modernization & design systems  
✨ Full-stack collaboration (Java, Node.js, Express, MongoDB)  

I design it in Figma.  
Then I build it pixel-perfect.  
Then I refactor it because I can do better.
